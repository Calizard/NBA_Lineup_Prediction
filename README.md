## Project Objectives  
The goal of this project is to design and develop a machine learning model that predicts the optimal fifth player for a home team in an NBA game, given partial lineup data and other game-related features. The model aims to maximize the home team's overall performance by analyzing historical NBA game data.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Analysis**: Utilize a dataset containing NBA game lineups from ***2007*** to ***2015***, which includes features such as `season`, `home_team`, `away_team`, `starting_min`, and player identifiers for both home and away teams (`home_0` to `home_4` and `away_0` to `away_4`).
2. **Feature Engineering**: Preprocess and transform the dataset to extract meaningful features that can be used to train the machine learning model.
3. **Model Development**: Build a machine learning model that predicts the optimal fifth player for the home team based on partial lineup data and other relevant features.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the model maximizes the home team's performance by evaluating its predictions against historical game outcomes.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights into how teams can optimize their lineups for better performance in future games.
